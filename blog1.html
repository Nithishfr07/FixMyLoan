        <p id="bb1">Impact of the repo rate hike on your home loan EMIs</p>
        <p id="bb2">The home loan interest rates have gone up by almost 2.5% in the last three years. The home loan rate of the State Bank of India (SBI) in May 2020 was 6.65% and in September 2023 it was 9.15%. An increase in the interest rate will definitely increase your interest outgo. However, if you think your Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) will increase too, then you are mistaken. Read on to find out why your EMI is not increasing despite an increase in interest rate. 
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Why don’t home loan lenders change the EMI amount?</p>
        <p id="bb2">During an interest rate hike, lenders often keep the EMI constant and increase the repayment duration. This is mainly because the EMIs are often automated (through standing instructions), NACH, post-dated cheques, etc., and changing the EMI amount may (sometimes) result in an unintentional EMI payment default. Defaulting an EMI payment will impact the borrower's credit rating. <br><br> Furthermore, keeping the EMI the same and increasing the loan tenure will also work in favor of the lender. The interest thus collected will be higher and profitable for the lender. 
        <br><br> However, to protect the borrower’s interest, RBI came up with a policy framework on 18 August 2023. As per the RBI’s notification, lenders must communicate to the borrowers the possible impact of benchmark interest rate changes on the loan lending - EMI and/or tenor or both.
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Scenario 1:</p>
        <p id="bb1">If your EMI is not changing with the change in interest rates</p>
        <p id="bb2">When interest rates rise, the interest you pay the bank also rises. However, if your EMI amount doesn't change, your loan's total tenor or duration will increase, and so will your total interest payment. Let's understand this with an example. <br><br>
        Suppose you took a loan of Rs 1 crore in May 2020 at a 6.65% interest rate for 15 years (or 180 months). The EMI of this loan is Rs 87,937. Hence, your total outflow is Rs 1 crore in principal and Rs 58.28 lakhs in interest. <br><br>
        In September 2023, the interest rates rose to 9.15%, but the EMI remains Rs 87,937, and the total duration now increases to 18.16 years (218 months). So, the loan you planned to pay off by 2035 will now end in 2038. The total interest payable will also increase to Rs 91.68 lakhs. That is an extra interest of Rs 33.4 Lakhs! <br><br>
        Let’s understand the consequences of having a constant EMI throughout your loan tenure:</p>
        <p id="bb1">Positives:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) No effect on your budget: A constant EMI will not harm your monthly budget as you will pay a fixed amount for your home loan. Moreover, there will be no surprises with respect to EMI payments.
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Negatives:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) Higher interest outgo: The total interest payment on your loan will go up drastically. In the above example, the total interest payment increased by Rs 33.4 lakhs due to an increase in the tenor by 3.16 years. This means you are spending more money towards your home loan by paying a constant EMI.</p>
        <p id="bb2">2) Disturbed financial timelines: A constant EMI will disturb your financial timelines as the tenor of the loan increases. This can affect all your other financial goals, such as retirement, vacation, or making other big-ticket purchases.</p>
        <p id="bb1">Scenario 2:</p>
        <p id="bb1">If your EMI is changing with the change in interest rates</p>
        <p id="bb2">With an increased interest rate, you can opt to increase your EMI to complete your loan on time. Rather than prolonging the loan tenor, you can increase the EMI and repay the home loan in the same tenor. <br><br>
        However, to do so, you need to calculate the additional EMI amount that you must pay to keep the tenor the same. A higher EMI may be heavy on your pockets but can also significantly lower the interest outflow. Thus, the suitable trade-off between the two needs to be identified based on your personal goals and financial <br><br>
        In the above example, an increase in interest rate from 6.65% to 9.15% will increase interest obligation. If you opt to increase your EMI and maintain your tenor at 15 years, the new EMI will be Rs 99,554.02 instead of Rs 87,937. The total interest will now be Rs 74.54 lakhs. <br><br>
        Since you opted to change your EMI, the total interest obligation will come down from Rs 91.68 lakhs to Rs 74.54 lakhs. Hence, you will save Rs 17.14 lakhs in interest payments if you increase your EMI amount with an increase in interest rates. <br><br>
        Let's look at the consequences of changing the EMI amount:
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Positives:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) On track with your financial goals: With increased interest rates, increasing the loan tenure will require you to pay more interest. As a result, your financial planning may take a toll as well. Instead, increasing your EMIs and keeping the tenor in check will help you stick to your financial goals and timelines.
        <br><br>
        2) Lower interest outgo: Higher EMI reduces the interest liability. In other words, higher EMI helps faster loan repayment, thus lowering the overall interest outgo. <br><br>
        3) Better use of money: Higher EMIs will help put your money to the best use. Repaying your home loan sooner will help you save on the interest payments. Thus, the sooner you pay off your loan, the sooner you will be debt-free. You can then choose to invest your cash or put it to better use for your other financial needs.</p>
        <p id="bb1">Negatives:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) Lower disposable income: Increasing your EMI may not always be pocket-friendly. Unrealistic high EMI payouts can often throw you off the wagon regarding your disposable income. Thus, you will have to re-plan your budget and expenses.
        <br><br>
        2) Time-consuming: To keep track of the interest rate changes, updating your standing instructions, and computing the EMI and interest payouts can often be time-consuming. Identifying the right EMI amount and repaying the home loan on time or even sooner will require your constant attention.

        <p id="bb1">Tips to reduce your home loan interest</p>
        <!-- <p style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 300;text-align: justify;padding: 14px;">The above two scenarios show that an increase in interest rates ultimately increases interest payments. Here are a few tips you could use to reduce the burden of interest rate changes on your home loan. <br><br>
        Prepay a part of your loan: Banks give borrowers the flexibility to prepay a part of a home loan. You can prepay a part of your loan and reduce the EMI. This is because the amount you prepay will be utilized towards your principal, reducing your total outstanding balance. In the above example, if you prepay even Rs 2 lakhs of your loan by keeping your EMI constant at Rs 87,937, the tenor of the loan will decrease from 18.16 years to 17.33 years. The total interest outlay will also decrease to Rs 85.96 lakhs. If you prepay a higher amount, the interest outflow will further reduce.
           <br><br> Pay an additional EMI: Paying an additional EMI per annum will also reduce your loan burden. You can pay the additional EMI out of your savings or your bonus. If you pay an additional EMI per annum, keeping your EMI constant at Rs 87,937, it can reduce the interest outflow to Rs 78.85 lakhs.
           <br><br> Step up EMI: Increasing your EMI by a certain percentage every year can be beneficial, too. You can align the increase in your EMI with your salary. For example, if your salary increases by 10% every year, you can step up your EMI by 10%. You can talk to your bank or change the auto-debit amount by yourself. This way, you can get your loan done faster and reduce your interest burden. If you increase your EMI payments by 10% yearly, you can repay the loan quicker and significantly reduce your interest.

        <p id="bb1">In conclusion</p>
        <p  id="bb2">A home loan is the biggest commitment in your life. Hence, you must be very careful during the tenure of your home loan. Comparing the above two scenarios, increasing the EMI during a rising interest rate scenario is a better option. In case the interest rates fall in the future, you can repay your loan faster as your EMIs are already higher.
           <br><br> Unlike investments, your loan obligations cannot be on autopilot. Adjusting your EMIs and loan tenor to reduce the debt obligation is prudent. Adjusting the EMIs with changing interest rates will work in your favor and lower the overall interest on the loan. Speak to your experts to determine your new EMI in a rising interest rate scenario.
