        <p id="bb1">Should I pay down my home loan with my bonus?</p>
        <p id="bb2">Prepaying your home loan is an important decision. Weigh the pros and cons of your decision against each other to make the right decision.
<br>
<br>
A yearly bonus feels like a green spot in the desert. It is everything that you've been waiting for and working hard for an entire year. However, the happiness of receiving a bonus is short-lived as you will be left with endless possibilities of how to use the bonus money. Some say prepay your loan as it relieves you from the stress, while others prefer investing it or even spending it on a holiday or a long pending big-ticket purchase. While all the possibilities are considered good enough, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of each possibility against one another. In this article, let’s see whether you must prepay your home loan with the bonus or not.
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Scenario 1:</p>
        <p id="bb1">When to prepay a home loan?</p>
        <p id="bb2">All salaried individuals know the burden of paying an EMI (equated monthly installment) and its effect on saving money for the long term. When you prepay a part of your loan, it will be used to reduce the principal amount you owe to the bank. Hence, prepaying a part of the home loan can reduce the interest expense, which will ultimately reduce the EMI amount significantly and can also help save money for the future. <br><br> Paying off a loan is always a good choice as your liabilities will reduce, and so will your stress. Below are some of the instances in which you should prioritize prepaying your home loan with the bonus amount.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li id="bb2"> Your aim is to be debt-free soon: Being debt-free gives you the freedom to spend and invest your money the way you want. If you plan to pay off all your debts before a certain age, then prepaying your home is a good idea.
                </li><li id="bb2">You have your basics covered: Every individual needs to ensure they have their emergency fund and insurance (both life and health) in place. If you have an emergency fund that covers at least six months of your expenses, then you can consider prepaying your home loan.
                </li><li id="bb2">Your credit utilization is high: It is normal for individuals to stretch their financial situation to buy a home. This is solely based on the assumption that the salary will increase in the future. However, many overlook the fact that the possibility of a job loss is also high. Ideally, EMIs shouldn't be more than 40% of your monthly income. If they are higher than 40% of your monthly income, then to bring down your credit utilization limit, you can prepay your home loan with your bonus.
            </li><li id="bb2">Underperforming market conditions: If the equity markets are subdued or other investments are giving low returns on investments, you can consider using the bonus to prepay a part of your home loan instead of investing it. Let's say you have a home loan of Rs 75 lakhs at a 7.5% interest rate with a tenure of 20 years. Five years down the line, you have an option of choosing an investment offering a 6% interest rate or prepaying a part of your home loan with your bonus of Rs 3 lakhs. Then, it is better to prepay your home loan as the return on the investment is very low.
                </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Advantages of prepaying a home loan:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) Lower EMIs: Prepaying a home can reduce the EMI amount significantly, as the amount you pay will be used for reducing the principal amount. In the above example, your EMI when you took a loan of Rs 60,419 and the total interest payment is Rs 70 lakhs for 20 years. After prepaying three lakhs after five years of the tenure, your total interest expense will reduce to Rs 64 lakhs, and the EMI will reduce to Rs 57,638 per month. The higher the prepayment amount, the higher your savings will be.
        </p>
        <p id="bb2">2) Reduced tenure of the loan: When prepaying your home loan, you can either choose to reduce your EMI or tenure. In the above example, if you wish to reduce your tenure instead of your EMI amount, you can complete the same loan in 18 years, 10 months instead of 20 years.
        </p>
        <p id="bb2">3) Lower outgo of money: By prepaying your home loan, the total interest expense will be reduced. The total interest expense in the above example before prepayment is Rs 70 lakhs, and after it is Rs 64 lakhs. Hence, the total savings is Rs 6 lakhs.
        </p>
        <p id="bb2">4)Long-term liquidity: Reducing your EMI or the tenure of your loan will help you save money, which can be invested to fulfill your long-term goals such as retirement.
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Disadvantages of not prepaying a home loan:
        </p>
        <p id="bb2">1) Prepayment charges: Many banks charge prepayment charges for home loans. The charge will range between 2-3% of the amount being repaid. If your bank charges 3% on Rs 3 lakhs of prepayment, Rs 9,000 will be used against the penalty, and the rest will go towards principal repayment. </p>
        <p id="bb2">2) Irreversible decision: Prepaying a home loan is an irreversible decision. If six months down the line, you need some money for an unexpected expense, you cannot ask the bank to give you back the money you prepaid against your home loan. </p>
        <p id="bb2">3) Loss of tax advantages: The government of India has given home buyers an opportunity to reduce their tax liability to the extent of Rs 1.5 lakhs on principal and Rs 2 lakhs on interest payments per annum. By prepaying your home loan, there is a chance of you losing out on these benefits. Hence, it is always best to check these benefits before prepaying your home loan. If these benefits can help reduce your tax liability, then prepaying is not a good idea. </p>
        <p id="bb1">Scenario 2:</p>
        <p id="bb1">When not to prepay your home loan?</p>
        <p id="bb2">Prepaying a home loan is a great option to reduce your interest expense. However, it is not always a wise decision. Following are some instances where you should not prepay your home loan.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li id="bb2">You are lagging in your goals: If you are investing towards your goals and are lagging behind, it’s better to step up your investments first rather than prepaying your home loan.  
            </li><li id="bb2">You have a significant expense: If you have a significant expense coming up, then use your bonus towards it instead of taking another loan to pay for that expense.
            </li><li id="bb2">Don’t have an investment: If you don’t have an emergency fund or any financial investment for your future, then it is best to save or invest your bonus amount.
            </li><li id="bb2">Have other high-interest debts: If you have other high-interest debts, then consider repaying those first than your home loan, as the interest expense will reduce.
                </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Advantages of prepaying a home loan:</p>
        <p id="bb2">1) Short-term liquidity: By not using the bonus to prepay your home loan, you will have enough money in your hand to fulfill your current needs and wants.
        <br><br>
        2) Invest for future goals: Investing for the future is very important. It will help you meet your future goals and financially secure your life. Hence, using your bonus to invest is a wise decision rather than prepaying your loan. 
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">Disadvantages of not prepaying a home loan:
        </p>
        <p id="bb2">1) The burden of loan: Loans can become a burden if your income falls or you lose your job. By prepaying your home loan, you can get done with your loan faster than expected.
        <br><br>
        2) Higher interest cost: Prepayment of a home loan can reduce interest expense. If interest rates increase, the interest cost on the outstanding loan also increases. <br><br>
        3) Lower disposable income: Prepayment reduces the EMI amount, which ultimately increases the disposable income in your hand. If you are not prepaying, then the EMI amount is still a major expense in your budget.
        </p>
        <p id="bb1">In conclusion</p>
        <p  id="bb2">Prepaying a home loan has numerous advantages but also has many disadvantages. Hence, it is best to weigh the pros against the cons and make an informed decision. Some products in the market, such as SBI's Maxgain, Axis Bank's Super Saver, HSBC's Smart Home, and Citi Bank's Home Credit, allow you to prepay a part of your home loan to reduce your interest expense but also allow you to withdraw the prepaid amount when you need it. Such products will help you take advantage of prepayment and, at the same time, help you fund your expenses with no liquidity crunch.  
           <br><br> Remember, owning a house is a big decision in life, so make no mistake with your home loan.
